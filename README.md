Below is the ReadMe for the Python code
This code first defines two functions: generate_workers and generate_payment_slips. The generate_workers function takes an integer num_workers as input and returns a list of num_workers dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a worker and has three keys: "name", "salary", and "gender". The values for these keys are randomly generated.
The generate_payment_slips function takes a list of workers as input and returns a list of payment slips. Each payment slip is a string that contains the worker's name, salary, and employee level. The employee level is determined by the worker's salary and gender, according to the following rules:
If the salary is greater than $10,000 and less than $20,000, the employee level is "A1".
If the salary is greater than $7,500 and less than $30,000 and the employee is female, the employee level is "A5-F".
Otherwise, the employee level is "No Level".
The code then creates a list of 503 workers using the generate_workers function and generates payment slips for all of the workers using the generate_payment_slips function. Finally, it prints each payment slip to the console.

This R code generates payment slips for NXU Staff members, assigning employee levels based on salary and gender criteria.
Key Features
Generates a list of 503 workers with random names, salaries, and genders.
Assign employee levels according to the following rules:
A1: Salary between $10,000 and $20,000
A5-F: Salary between $7,500 and $30,000, and gender is female
No Level: Otherwise
Creates payment slips displaying worker name, salary, and employee level.
Running the Code
Save the code as an R script (e.g., payment_slip_generator.R).
Open the script in RStudio or an R console.
Execute the code by clicking "Run" or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Enter or Command+Enter).
The payment slips will be printed to the console.
Functions
generate_workers(num_workers): Generates a list of workers with random data.
generate_payment_slips(workers): Creates payment slips for each worker.
Main Execution
Sets num_workers to 503.
Calls generate_workers to create a list of workers.
Calls generate_payment_slips to generate payment slips.
Prints each payment slip to the console.
